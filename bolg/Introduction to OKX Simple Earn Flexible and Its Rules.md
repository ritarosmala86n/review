# Introduction to OKX Simple Earn Flexible and Its Rules

OKX Simple Earn is an innovative value-added service that enables users to deposit their crypto assets and earn market-based interest on an hourly basis. The service offers unmatched flexibility, allowing users to withdraw their assets anytime, while ensuring the safety of funds through a robust risk management system. This allows users to earn profits with peace of mind.

## Use of Assets

Crypto assets deposited in OKX Simple Earn are loaned to margin traders. The service exclusively supports listed cryptocurrencies that are eligible for margin trading.

## Subscription and Redemption

### 1. Subscription
Users can subscribe to OKX Simple Earn at any time. Upon subscription, the deposited crypto is locked into Simple Earn and enters the interest rate bidding process. If the bid is successful, the crypto will be lent to margin traders.

### 2. Redemption
Subscribers can redeem their crypto at any time and will receive their funds immediately. However, once redeemed, the crypto will not participate in subsequent interest rate bidding and will not generate interest for the current hour.

## Rules for Deposit Limits

There are no fixed deposit or redemption limits. However, OKX retains the right to adjust these limits based on the latest market conditions and risk assessments.

## Interest Rate Setting and Distribution

### 1. Interest Rate Setting
When subscribing, users can set their minimum lending Annual Percentage Rate (APR). This can be revised anytime on the order details page. OKX Simple Earn reviews borrowing demand every hour and matches lending bids based on the minimum lending APR. The system approves loans based on the following rules:

- If your minimum lending APR is lower than the market APR, your funds will be loaned at the market APR.
- If your minimum lending APR equals the market APR, your funds may be partially loaned or not loaned at all.
- If your minimum lending APR is higher than the market APR, your funds will not be loaned, and no interest will be earned for that hour.

**Special Condition:** If the supply of lender funds is nearly exhausted, the market APR may increase to attract more lenders. However, even in this scenario, funds with a minimum APR below the new market APR might not be loaned.

In cases where multiple lenders set the same minimum APR as the market APR, loans are approved on a first-come, first-served basis.

### 2. Interest Calculation and Distribution
For successfully matched lending offers during hour T, the corresponding hourly interest for the loan amount from T to T+1 will be distributed at T+1. The interest distribution breakdown is as follows:

- 15% of the interest is deposited as margin.
- 85% of the interest is distributed to Simple Earn users.

**Interest Formula:**  
Actual Interest = Actual Loan Amount * (Current APR Ã· 365 Ã· 24) * 85%

### 3. Source and Use of Margin
A margin, comprising 15% of the interest paid by margin traders, is set aside to cover potential losses. OKX reserves the right to repurpose the margin under specific conditions. If losses exceed the margin, up to 50% of users' daily interest may be used to offset the loss, while the platform temporarily covers the remainder. These amounts are subsequently recovered from future margins and daily interest.
