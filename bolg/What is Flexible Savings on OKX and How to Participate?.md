Flexible Savings, an upgrade from the former "YuBiBao," is a product designed by **OKX** to connect users with idle digital assets to those with borrowing needs. It features **flexible deposits and withdrawals, hourly interest accrual, and customizable interest rates**.

When users deposit digital assets into Flexible Savings, the system will attempt to match their lending rate with borrowers' needs on the hour. If successful, users earn interest for that hour; otherwise, they must wait for the next hourly match.
