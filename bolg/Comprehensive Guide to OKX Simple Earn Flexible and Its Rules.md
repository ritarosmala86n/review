## Rules for Deposit Limits

OKX imposes no fixed limits on deposits or redemptions. However, the platform reserves the right to adjust these limits based on prevailing market conditions and associated risks.

## Interest Rate Settings and Distribution

### 1. Interest Rate Setting
OKX Simple Earn allows users to set their minimum lending Annual Percentage Rate (APR) during subscription. This rate can be adjusted anytime on the order details page. Borrowing demand is evaluated hourly, and lending bids are sorted from the lowest to the highest minimum lending APR until loan demand is fully satisfied. The highest accepted minimum APR determines the market APR.

**Loan Approval Rules:**

- **Below Market APR:** Funds are loaned at the market APR.
- **At Market APR:** Funds may be partially or fully loaned, or not loaned at all.
- **Above Market APR:** Funds are not loaned, and no interest is earned.

**Special Case:** If the total supply of lender funds is nearly exhausted, the market APR may increase to attract more lenders. However, even in such cases, funds with minimum APRs below the new market APR might not be loaned.

If multiple lenders set the same minimum APR as the market APR, loans are approved on a first-come, first-served basis.

### 2. Interest Calculation and Distribution
For successfully matched offers at hour T, the hourly interest for the loan amount from T to T+1 is distributed at T+1. The breakdown is as follows:

- **85%** of the interest is distributed to users.
- **15%** is allocated to the platform as a margin reserve.

**Formula for Actual Interest:**

```
Actual Interest = Actual Loan Amount Ã— (Current APR Ã· 365 Ã· 24) Ã— 85%
```

### 3. Source and Use of Margin
The margin reserve comprises 15% of the interest paid by margin traders. This reserve is used to cover potential losses. In the event of significant losses exceeding the margin reserve, up to 50% of users' daily interest may be appropriated to cover the deficit. The platform temporarily covers any remaining losses and recoups these funds through future margins and daily interest.
