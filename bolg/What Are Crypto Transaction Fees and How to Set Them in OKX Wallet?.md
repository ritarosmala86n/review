# What Are Crypto Transaction Fees and How to Set Them in OKX Wallet?

If you want to maximize your Web3 experience, understanding crypto transaction fees is essential. Also known as gas fees on certain blockchains, these fees impact how quickly transactions are confirmed and how much you pay for network usage. 

This guide will cover the basics of crypto transaction fees, the relationship between fees and transaction speed, and how fees are calculated on different networks. Additionally, we‚Äôll walk you through how to set fees on over 20 networks supported by the OKX Wallet. Let‚Äôs dive in!

## What Are Crypto Transaction Fees?

Crypto transaction fees are small amounts paid when transferring digital assets or interacting with smart contracts on networks like Ethereum or OKC. These fees incentivize miners or validators to process and confirm transactions, with all fees included in a block being awarded to the miner or validator who adds that block to the blockchain.

### Why Are Crypto Transaction Fees Important?

Transaction fees serve several crucial purposes:

- **Incentivizing Miners and Validators**: Fees reward those who operate the hardware that processes transactions.
- **Preventing Network Spam**: By financially disincentivizing spam transactions, fees ensure network integrity.
- **Prioritizing Transactions**: Transactions with higher fees are processed faster.
- **Supporting Monetary Policy**: Fees can reduce circulating supply when burned, as seen with Ethereum's EIP-1559 upgrade.

## How Are Transaction Fees Calculated on Different Blockchains?

The method of fee calculation varies between blockchains. Here‚Äôs a quick overview:

### Bitcoin
Bitcoin uses a simple fee model based solely on network congestion. Miners prioritize transactions with higher fees when blocks are full.

### Ethereum
Ethereum employs a more complex fee structure, as transactions can vary in computational intensity. For example, minting an NFT requires more gas (computation) than transferring ETH. The fee is calculated based on gas usage and the current gas price. Learn more about Ethereum‚Äôs gas system [here](https://bit.ly/OKXe).

### Solana
Solana uses deterministic fees, where the network sets the required fee based on previous transaction volumes and the complexity of the current transaction. Recently, Solana has introduced a local fee market to address network congestion during peak demand.

## Why Do Transaction Fees Fluctuate?

Crypto transaction fees are influenced by three key factors:

1. **Block Limit and Block Time**: Larger blocks and faster block times can process more transactions, reducing congestion and lowering fees.
2. **Network Congestion**: High transaction volumes lead to higher fees due to competition for block space.
3. **Auction-Style Fee Model**: On most blockchains, transactions with the highest fees are prioritized, creating a bidding war during congestion.

While low fees are appealing, they often come at the expense of decentralization. Larger blocks require more expensive hardware, reducing the number of network participants and increasing centralization.

## How to Set Transaction Fees in OKX Wallet

The OKX Wallet supports over 20 blockchains and allows users to easily set transaction fees. Let‚Äôs explore the process.

### Steps to Set a Crypto Transaction Fee in OKX Wallet

1. **Set Up and Fund Your Wallet**: Follow these [instructions](https://bit.ly/OKXe) to create and fund your OKX Wallet.
2. **Open the Wallet**: Tap **Wallet** on the OKX app home screen.
3. **Initiate a Transaction**: For example, start a token swap on the OKC network.
4. **View Transaction Details**: Before confirming, you‚Äôll see the default network fee (set to ‚ÄúAverage‚Äù).
5. **Edit the Fee**: Tap **Network Fee** and choose:
   - **Slow**: Lower fee but slower confirmation.
   - **Average**: Balanced fee and confirmation time.
   - **Fast**: Higher fee for faster confirmation.
   - **Custom**: Advanced users can specify gas price and gas limit for precise control.

6. **Confirm the Transaction**: After setting your fee, confirm the transaction and enter your wallet password.

### Advanced: Setting a Custom Fee in OKX Wallet

For advanced users, OKX Wallet allows you to customize gas prices and limits:

- **Gas Price**: The amount paid per unit of gas.
- **Gas Limit**: The maximum amount of gas allocated for the transaction.

Setting custom fees is useful in high-demand situations, such as NFT drops or avoiding liquidation in DeFi protocols. However, novice users should avoid customizing fees to prevent overpaying or failed transactions.
