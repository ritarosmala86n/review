# Step-by-Step Guide: Connecting OKX Trading Bot with TradingView Signal Indicators

## Getting Started

Before automating your trades with the OKX trading bot and TradingView, ensure youâ€™ve completed the necessary preparations. Follow these steps for a seamless integration:

### **Preparation Checklist**
1. **Create an OKX Account**  
   If you donâ€™t already have an OKX account, [Click to view â˜ž OKX Welcome Limited-Time Offer, Claim Up to 100 USDT Reward](https://bit.ly/OKXe) and sign up.  
   - Apply for a V5 API key in your OKX account.  
   - Set permissions to **read-only** and **trade**, but **do not enable withdrawal permissions**. Confirm and save your API key details.  

2. **Clear Existing Positions**  
   Before connecting strategies to the bot, ensure all current positions in the chosen trading pair are closed. This avoids conflicts or errors during automated trades.

3. **One Strategy Per Trading Pair**  
   You can run multiple strategies across different trading pairs but limit each pair to one strategy at a time to maintain clean management.

4. **Avoid Manual Intervention**  
   Refrain from manually adjusting positions connected to an automated strategy. If manual changes occur, stop the bot and restart it to sync the data.

5. **Adjust Order Mode in OKX Settings**  
   If orders fail to execute, go to the OKX trading interface, find the **Order Mode** setting, and switch to **Buy/Sell Mode**.

## **Step-by-Step Usage**

### **1. Set Up Alerts in TradingView**
Make sure to use OKX as the data source in TradingView. Most TradingView indicators provide buy/sell signals, which you can utilize for automated trading. For example, as shown in the image below, alerts can be configured based on specific indicators:

Once these trading signals are identified, you can connect them directly to TVCBot.

---

### **2. Configure the OKX Trading Bot**
- Navigate to the OKX trading bot page in TVCBot.
- Select the desired trading pair and indicator from your TradingView setup.  
- For example, if youâ€™re using a **buy signal**, configure the bot to go **long** on the pair.  
- Input your order size and set stop-loss and take-profit parameters as required.

- Copy the **TVCBot message** into the alert message field in TradingView.
- Copy the **Webhook URL** into the Webhook URL field in TradingView.
- Name your alert, e.g., **BTCUSDT Buy Signal**.

This completes the buy signal integration.

---

### **4. Configure Sell Signals**
- Repeat the steps for sell signals as needed.  
- When generating configurations, youâ€™ll have additional options like enabling **reverse orders** or **position scaling**:
  - **Reverse Orders**: Automatically closes an existing position (e.g., long) before opening the opposite position (e.g., short).
  - **Position Scaling Protection**: Prevents duplicate orders and disallows adding to an existing position. If your TradingView strategy uses pyramiding (paramiding), ensure this setting is disabled.

---

## **Key Features and Options**

1. **Reverse Orders**  
   - Enabled: The bot will check for current positions before placing a new order. For example, a long position will be closed before opening a short position.
   - Disabled: The bot wonâ€™t check existing positions. For example, if you hold 2 BTC in a long position, opening a 1 BTC short position will partially close your long position, leaving 1 BTC long.

2. **Position Scaling Protection**  
   - Default: Enabled. Prevents adding to existing positions.  
   - Disabled: Needed if your TradingView strategy uses pyramiding with `Paramiding` settings greater than 1.
