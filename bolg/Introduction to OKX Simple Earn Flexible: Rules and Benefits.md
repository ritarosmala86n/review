### Subscription and Redemption

#### 1. Subscription
Users can subscribe to Simple Earn at any time. Upon subscription, the crypto assets are locked to participate in interest rate bidding. If the bidding is successful, the assets are lent to margin traders.

#### 2. Redemption
Assets can be redeemed at any time, and users will receive the redeemed crypto immediately. However, redeemed assets will no longer participate in interest rate bidding or generate interest for the current hour.

## Flexible Rules for Deposits and Redemptions
There are no fixed limits for deposits or redemptions. OKX reserves the right to adjust these limits based on market conditions and associated risks.

## Interest Rates and Distribution

### 1. Interest Rate Setting
- Users can set a minimum lending Annual Percentage Rate (APR) when subscribing.
- OKX matches lending bids hourly, sorting them by minimum APR from the lowest to the highest until loan demand is satisfied. 
- The highest accepted minimum APR determines the current market APR.

#### Loan Matching Rules:
- **Below Market APR:** Your funds will be loaned at the market APR.
- **Equal to Market APR:** Funds may be partially loaned or not loaned at all.
- **Above Market APR:** Funds will not be loaned, and no interest will be earned for that hour.

If supply is nearly fully loaned out, OKX may raise the market APR to attract more lenders. However, this could result in no interest earnings for certain lenders, even if their minimum APR is below the raised market APR. Loans at the same APR are approved on a first-come, first-served basis.

### 2. Interest Calculation and Distribution
- Interest is calculated hourly and distributed the following hour for successfully matched lending offers.
- **Distribution Breakdown:** 85% of the interest goes to users, while 15% is held as margin to cover potential losses.  
- Formula: `Actual interest = Actual loan amount * Current APR / 365 / 24 * 85%`

### 3. Use of Margin
- The 15% margin is utilized to cover potential losses. In cases where losses exceed the margin, up to 50% of Simple Earn usersâ€™ daily interest may be used to address the shortfall. Remaining losses are temporarily covered by the platform and gradually deducted from the margin and daily interest in the future.

## Supported Crypto and Price Adjustments
- Crypto price â‰¥ 1,000 USDT: 0.0001
- 100 USDT â‰¤ Crypto price < 1,000 USDT: 0.001
- 10 USDT â‰¤ Crypto price < 100 USDT: 0.01
- 1 USDT â‰¤ Crypto price < 10 USDT: 0.1
- Crypto price < 1 USDT: 1
