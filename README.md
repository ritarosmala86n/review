## Flexible vs. Fixed Loans: What‚Äôs the Difference?

OKX offers two primary types of loans: **Flexible Loans** and **Fixed Loans**. Each caters to different needs, providing users with options based on their risk tolerance and financial goals.

### Fixed Loans

Fixed loans on OKX are straightforward. Borrowers can access USDT using four types of crypto collateral: **USDT**, **BTC**, **ETH**, and OKX's native token **OKB**. Key features include:

- **Interest Rates**: Fixed and depend on the amount borrowed, collateral, and loan duration (7, 15, 30, 90, or 180 days). Longer durations and higher collateral reduce liquidation risks.
- **Limitations**: Early repayment incurs penalties, and overdue payments beyond three days lead to automatic liquidation.

> üí° **Tip**: Fixed loans are ideal for those with predictable financial needs and the ability to adhere to repayment schedules.

### Flexible Loans

Flexible loans provide borrowers with more options, making them an appealing choice for those seeking adaptability. Here's what makes them stand out:

1. **Collateral Options**:
   - **Single-Collateral Loans**: Use one type of crypto asset as collateral.
   - **Multi-Collateral Loans**: Combine multiple crypto assets as collateral for a single loan, offering higher borrowing limits.
   
2. **Interest Calculation**:
   - Accrued hourly, allowing borrowers to monitor and manage costs dynamically.
   
3. **Repayment Flexibility**:
   - Repay partially or in full at any time without incurring penalties.
   
4. **Broad Asset Support**:
   - Access loans using up to 10 different cryptocurrencies.

> üîç Flexible loans are a great option for those who value control and flexibility in their borrowing.
